                    <h3>Top Cultural Landmarks and Modern Marvels in Baku</h3>
                    <p>Wander through the narrow cobbled streets of <strong>Icherisheher (Old City)</strong> and you’ll step back centuries into the heart of medieval Azerbaijan. Within its ancient walls stands the iconic <strong>Maiden Tower</strong>, one of Baku’s most mysterious architectural symbols, offering panoramic views over the Caspian Sea. Nearby, the magnificent <strong>Palace of the Shirvanshahs</strong> reflects the grandeur of the Shirvan rulers and remains one of the finest examples of medieval Islamic architecture in the region.

Just outside the Old City walls lies the elegant <strong>Fountains Square</strong>, a lively hub filled with cafes, shops, and street performances. From here, a short walk takes you to the scenic <strong>Baku Boulevard</strong>, stretching along the Caspian coastline. This seaside promenade is perfect for a relaxing stroll, especially at sunset when the city skyline begins to glow.

Baku’s modern identity shines through its bold architectural statements. The world-renowned <strong>Heydar Aliyev Center</strong>, designed by Zaha Hadid, is a masterpiece of contemporary design with its flowing curves and futuristic form. It symbolizes the dynamic and forward-looking spirit of modern Azerbaijan. Nearby, the striking <strong>Flame Towers</strong> dominate the skyline, illuminated at night with captivating LED displays that represent the country’s nickname, the “Land of Fire.”

For those interested in cultural exploration, the <strong>Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum</strong> showcases the rich heritage of Azerbaijani carpet weaving, housed in a uniquely designed building shaped like a rolled carpet. Meanwhile, art lovers can explore exhibitions at the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong>, where local and international works highlight the creative pulse of the city.

No visit to Baku is complete without experiencing its natural wonders. A short drive from the city leads to the <strong>Ateshgah Fire Temple</strong> and the ever-burning flames of <strong>Yanar Dag</strong>, both reflecting Azerbaijan’s ancient connection to fire worship and natural gas phenomena.

From its fortified medieval walls to its shimmering skyscrapers, Baku is a destination where tradition and innovation coexist harmoniously. Whether you’re drawn by history, architecture, culture, or simply the charm of the Caspian coast, Baku promises an unforgettable journey.</p>

                    <h3>Exploring Azerbaijani Cuisine: The Tradition and Taste of Dolma</h3>
                    <p>Azerbaijan’s culinary heritage is a feast for the senses, and Dolma stands as its undisputed crown jewel. In 2017, Azerbaijan’s tradition of making and sharing dolma was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list. This recognition highlights not only the dish itself, but also the deep cultural meaning behind its preparation, presentation, and communal enjoyment.

At its heart, <strong>Dolma</strong> is a dish built on care and craftsmanship. The name comes from the Turkic word “dolmak,” meaning “to fill,” and the concept is simple yet endlessly versatile: vegetables or leaves are carefully stuffed with a flavorful mixture, most commonly minced meat, rice, herbs, and spices. However, each region of Azerbaijan adds its own touch, creating a rich diversity of flavors and techniques.

One of the most beloved varieties is <strong>Yarpaq Dolması</strong>, made by wrapping tender grape leaves around a delicate filling of lamb or beef mixed with rice, fresh herbs such as dill and mint, and subtle spices. These small, neatly rolled parcels are gently simmered and traditionally served with a side of thick yogurt or garlic sauce, balancing richness with freshness.

Another popular version is <strong>Üç Bacı Dolması</strong> (“Three Sisters Dolma”), where tomatoes, eggplants, and bell peppers are stuffed and baked together. This colorful trio reflects both the abundance of local produce and the Azerbaijani appreciation for harmony in presentation and taste. In rural areas, you may also encounter cabbage dolma or even stuffed quince, showcasing the creativity embedded in the cuisine.

Beyond its ingredients, <strong>Dolma</strong> carries strong social significance. It is a centerpiece at family gatherings, weddings, and festive celebrations such as Novruz. Preparing dolma is often a collective activity — family members sit together, wrapping leaves and sharing stories. In this way, the dish becomes more than food; it becomes a symbol of unity, hospitality, and continuity between generations.

The taste of Azerbaijani dolma is defined by balance. It is aromatic but not overpowering, rich yet refined. Fresh herbs play a key role, giving the filling brightness and depth. The slow cooking process allows the flavors to meld together, creating a comforting and deeply satisfying experience with every bite.

For travelers exploring Azerbaijan, tasting <strong>Dolma</strong> is essential to understanding the country’s identity. It reflects the agricultural richness of the land, the influence of Silk Road traditions, and the warmth of Azerbaijani hospitality. More than just a national dish, dolma is a living tradition — one that continues to bring people together around the table, preserving both flavor and heritage.</p>
